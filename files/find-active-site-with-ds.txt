1. Open your protein with DS
2. "View" - "hierarchy (or Ctrl+H)
3. Now select "Hetatom" and press "delete"
4. Go to "Receptor-ligand interaction"
5. Now click "define and edit binding site"
6. Now click "add hydrogen atom" (it will help use to find more accurate binding site of protein)
7. There are two way to predict binding site in DS
	a. from receptor cavities
	b. from PDB site records
Now we use first one - "from receptor cavities" by clicking it
	Now will you see some site in your task bar - site 1, site 2...
	Bydefault DS gives us top binding site as "site 1"
8. Click the "site 1", a sphere will appear in to your protein
9. Right click on site 1, and open attribute
10. Now find the "xyz coordinate" for protein binding site.
